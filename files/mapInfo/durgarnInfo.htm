        <h1>DURGARN SEA</h1>

        <p>The largest open ocean in the world, the Durgarn Sea sits above a subducting continental plate. As a result, the coasts of Nothokejtag, Noros, Rundar Tor and Vandor√ªn that border the sea are all heavily volcanic and subject to frequent earthquakes. Over all however, this ocean has a reputation for being a sailor's dream. With much of the heavily traveled regions being equatorial, the waters tend to be generally calm and the weather good. Things get more stormy the further south you travel, but in general the waters are warm and calm. Unfortunately this can occasionally be a danger as much of a blessing: ships don't often risk sailing too far out to sea if they can avoid it, as the huge expanse of water with few landmasses can mean that getting stranded too far from shore with weeks of little to no wind is an often fatal mistake.</p>
