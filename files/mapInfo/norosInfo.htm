        <h1>NOROS</h1>

        <p>Noros is a crowded continent, the historic home to humans, Halflings, Tieflings, Tabaxi, and Lizardfolk. Being centered between Arwom, Rundar Tor, and Vandor没n as well as only a short distance from Achuakia and Nothokejtag, today it's even more diverse. You can find members of nearly every race in nearly every town, with only slightly greater concentrations in specific regions.</p>
<p>To the north west and north east, you'll find Tieflings, Drow, and Tabaxi in greater numbers than elsewhere. Humans are the most common across the temperate northern region of the continent. To the south, most towns are heavily populated by Lizardfolk, orcs, and Dragonborn. There are a great number of Dwarves and elves near the isthmus between Noros and Rundar Tor, and Halfling communities all along the north west. Goliaths and Firbogs aren't frequently seen outside of Arwom, but if you're going to run into one elsewhere, it'll be in Noros. But even the most homogenous communities have their fair share of diverse residents, as a continent deeply involved in world-wide trade.</p>
<p>For many people who have not traveled much outside of more culturally and racially homogenous regions (mainly Nothokejtag, Achuakia, southern Rundar Tor, and eastern Vandor没n), traveling anywhere in Noros can feel a little overwhelming, where so much cultural blending can turn even familiar holidays or religions into strangely foreign versions of what they knew back home.</p>
<p>Of course, all this diversity doesn't totally negate prejudice.</p>
<p>Lizardfolk tend to remain by-and-large in the tropical southern regions, which suits their overall health better, as tropical reptilians. Outside of the south plenty of myths and stereotypes about them abound, ranging from them being simple country bumpkins, to them being actively cannibalistic to other sentient races.</p>
<p>Tieflings were long discriminated against due to a belief that they are demonic in nature and therefore inherently evil. Most people now acknowledge that this is not in fact true, but prejudices don't disappear overnight. 400 years ago, a renowned tiefling, Glory Greylock, became one of the few Tiefling rulers in Oudn history, in Jalcanis in north-eastern Noros (and the namesake of the second month of the year). He made great strides to improve conditions and equality for both drow and tieflings living in Jalcanis, a sentiment which spread to nearby Hoffel and Alesund. However, not all of the continent followed suit, and today many Tieflings tend to remain in or move to one of these three countries if they have the means to to avoid the discrimination they may face elsewhere, which may range from merely annoying, to actively dangerous.</p>
<p>There aren't many drow living outside of Rundar Tor and Vandor没n, but a few communities settled in and around Jalcanis centuries ago as refugees fleeing a war with the then-invading Dwarven country of Tyrkak. Their Elven brethren have long held prejudices against the Drow, many finding underground living unnatural and repellent for elves. After many Drow fled Vandor没n and ended up in Rundar Tor, they found themselves competing for subterranean real estate with dwarves, causing much tension between the two races. With relations between elves and Dwarves much more long established, other countries and races frequently adopted their prejudices against the Drow as well, leading to considerable discrimination. Since Glory Greylock's time things have improved somewhat, but not everywhere and not for everyone.</p>
