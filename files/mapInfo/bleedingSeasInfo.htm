            <h1>THE BLEEDING SEAS</h1>

            <p>The Bleeding Seas, centered between Isfjell, Noros, and Rundar Tor, has been a center of conflict and danger for hundreds of years. Before the Treaty of Rorvik, naval warfare, raids, and piracy abounded on these seas. Every county in Noros along the Bleeding Seas coast would allow its coast guard forces to freely capture and confiscate the goods, ships, and sometimes even passengers of any foreign ships that dared sail too near. The smaller dwarven nations in Rundar Tor often had to band together for protection against these attacks in tentative alliances, which were constantly shifting at a time when many of the dwarven kingdoms were experiencing their own internal conflict as they fought over limited territory. Meanwhile, Brunholl had been making a living from raiding both Noros and Rundar Tor, as well as Vandor√ªn on occasion, for almost a century by the time the Treaty was enacted, and they were just as comfortable raiding ships on the seas as they were villages on land, and targeted any ship indiscriminately, warship or merchant ship, even lowly fishing skiffs.</p>
            <p>Time was it wasn't uncommon to be sailing through this part of the ocean and to come across a patch of water that was entirely red with blood of the victims of some unfortunate encounter, and so they became known colloquially as the Bleeding Seas.</p>
            <p>Though times are far more peaceful today, the name stuck around, and sailors' legends say that the sharks and other ocean predators are more blood-thirsty here than anywhere else in the world, having spent so long gorging on the flesh of sailors.</p>
