        <h1>THE SEA OF SOULS</h1>

        <p>The Sea of Souls, located between Arwom and Noros, is so named as a reminder of the unusually high number of of lives these treacherous waters have claimed.</p>
        <p>The sea is dangerous, with cold winds from the north mixing with hot, southern weather fronts creating high winds and dangerous storms. However, trade between Noros and Urús is considered more valuable than the risks traveling between them presents, and so merchants—and pirates—continue to make the journey. Even though there are plenty of island between the two continents to utilize as places to weather storms while island hopping your way across, it's a far safer idea to hug the coasts instead and aoid the perils of open water, even though that can add weeks, if not months, to your journey.</p>
