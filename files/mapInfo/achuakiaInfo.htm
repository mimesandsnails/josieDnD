        <h1>ACHUAKIA</h1>

        <p>The Dragonborn homeland. Rich with resources and blessed with a subtropical climate that features mild winters and hot summers, Achuakia would be considered a tourist's paradise if it weren't for all the tsunamis and earthquakes that result from it being located right on top of a highly tectonically active region.</p>
        <p>Even before the global trade system was established, Achuakian Dragonborns were traveling to Nothokejtag and southern Noros to trade goods, and the abundant natural resources on the island led to a relatively peaceful, conflict free culture for most Dragonborns. With their long history, they get along well with orcs, and lizardfolk in particular, whom most Dragonborn view as (very) distant kin. At least, they share more similarities than other humanoids.</p>
        <p>Achuakia's main exports are spices and produce including cinnamon, coffee, and cacao, along with some luxury cultural goods such as Achuakian carpets and other textiles, which are hand-woven and dyed via elaborate, time consuming processes, and are considered highly desirable imports for the wealthy classes around the world.</p>
        <p>As an important luxury trading center, Achuakian cities tend to be bustling places filled with non-Dragonborns, either visiting temporarily on merchant vessels, or having permanently set up shop, sometimes generations before. However, outside the cities in smaller towns and villages, you'll find fewer non-Dragonborns. People tend to be slightly intimidated by the Dragonborn unless they were born on the island, and often choose to live in the more diverse cities.</p>
