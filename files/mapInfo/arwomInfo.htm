        <h1>ARWOM</h1>

        <p>

          Arwom is a large continent that encompasses the Empire of Urús, several smaller independent countries to the south, and the Western Wilds along the western coast.</br>
          </br>
          Urús dominates the continent, and much of it is desert and steppes. You can find members of all races here, but <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human">Humans</a>, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc">Orcs</a>, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goliath">Goliaths</a>, and <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn">Dragonborn</a> make up the general majority.<br>
          <br>
          Over a century ago a group of nomadic auroch herders in the steppes began to take over nearby communities in order to expand their herds. Over time this became a conquering empire, expanding the country’s borders all the way to the eastern coast, nearly to the southern one, and to the edge of the steppes in the west. The invading empire was more interested in land rights than governing at the beginning, and later in claiming luxury resources as nominal taxes upon the inhabitants of the empire. After a devastating plague halted expansion, a capital city was established close to the eastern coast, where further trade could be facilitated with the continent of Noros. The heart of the government settled there, and the only relationship most of the rest of the country has with it is the export of goods and resources (mostly livestock by-products and silver) to keep the capital in a state of wealth and luxury. Given that the empire’s territory is so expansive, most regions are not taxed heavily enough to feel anything other than minor irritation about the matter. <br>
          <br>
          Outside of the capital city, most people live either in small towns and villages in the mountains, or as semi-nomadic gatherer/hunters and pastoralists in the steppes and desert. Today these people consider themselves nominally as inhabitants of the Empire, but personal identity is more broken up along subsistence and lifestyle lines. <br>
          <br>
          The steppes are filled with nomadic horse riders and auroch/goat herders. They keep enormous the oxen, which require great physical strength and stamina to control, and well as goats which they use for milk, cheese, and wool. Communities are mixed, but mostly consist of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human">Human</a>, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc">Orcs</a>, and <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn">Dragonborn</a>. There is little inter-species conflict within each community, as good cooperation is frequently the different between life and death, although the limited resources do spark conflicts between neighboring communities. They are stern people, happy to solve problems with their fists. Wary at first, but form very strong social bonds when won over. <br>
          <br>
          National cultural identity within the eastern forests is much stronger and more coherent. People tend to live in permanent settlements, ranging from small villages to medium sized cities--none as large or luxurious as the capitol city of Gildroad though. Farms in this region keep permanent settlements fed, and a few logging and quarry towns in the south-east ensure there is enough wood and stone for construction. However, the real international economic power of Urús is its silver mines, the largest supply of the world's silver. Many of the people outisde the capital in the north-east live and work in mining towns in the coastal mountain ranges.<br>

          <br>
          Further north in the boreal regions, people are more sedentary, less confrontational, and mostly herd yaks rather than aurochs. The majority of them are <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human">Humans</a>, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Firbolg">Firbolgs</a> with frost giant ancestry, and silver and white <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn">Dragonborn</a>. They typically move back and forth between summer and winter settlements, following available plant growth. They can usually be relied upon to help strangers in need, as the harsh landscape frequently means that everyone depends on the aid of others to survive, especially during the brutal winter months. However, they don’t want strangers to overstay their welcome, and rarely invite them in as a permanent part of the clan. Grazing land is a luxury, and they are wary of more people stretching the resources even thinner.<br>

          <br>

          To the west, the forested regions were never conquered by the Sorvagur Empire after a plague halted its advance. The region is resource rich and relatively sparsely populated. Once notable race among the many that can be found here is Wild Elves, who left Vandorun some point tens of thousands of years before and spread up and down Arwom's western coast, but not much inland where the desert offered little protection. Firbolgs, Gnomes, and Tabaxi are also common sites in this mountainous, forested region. <br>
          People live together in small to medium sized tribes with some broadly overlapping cultural identities, but nothing larger in social structure than a chiefdom. The widespread availability of resources and mild climate has resulted in little inter-tribal conflict and well-established trade-routes. The region is referred to as the Western Wilds by the people of Sorvagur as it has no single cultural identity or governing body, although its inhabitants would argue that Sorvagur is a far more dangerous and tenuous place to live. <br>

          <br>

          To the south of the continent there are several smaller tropical countries. Limited in space by the encroaching border of Sorvagur, there are frequent tensions and border disputes as territory is lost and won, usually by relatively minor increments. These tensions are largely limited to the respective governments of each country, with the inhabitants generally considering themselves of the same general cultural stock, particularly in contrast with the nationalistic identity of Sorvagur just to the north—no longer posing an actual threat of invasion, but the historical memory of that threat has lingered these long decades.
