        <h1>RUNDAR TOR</h1>

        <p>Rundar Tor is the historically Dwarven and Gnomish homeland. Today, most of the population across the continent consists of Dwarves and Elves.</p>
        <p>Most of the large Dwarven cities are entirely or mostly subterranean, but there are plenty of above-ground Dwarven villages, farmsteads, and towns. Gnomes fill the forests, valleys, and mountain above ground, and many elves moving west from Vandorûn have also settled in these sparsely populated regions. Large cities tend to cluster around the coasts where the most trade occurs, and these are quite diverse. Below ground, Dwarves live alongside deep gnomes and Drow—not always peacefully. There are a greater number of Dwarves than Drow and deep gnomes combined, and they had long laid claim to most of the best natural cave systems and most structurally sound regions for excavation, and the Drow and deep gnomes are often pushed out to less desirable or less stable regions.</p>
        <p>Some deep gnomes live in Dwarven cities, though a long history of territorial conflict between the two races has resulted in many deep gnomes choose to live in smaller peripheral communities—although they so prefer living below ground to above, that if given the choice, they'd rather cohabit with Dwarves than move above ground to live alongside their gnomish cousins.</p>
        <p>While the deep gnomes generally prefer to either avoid or cohabit with Dwarves, the relationship between Dwarves and Drow is much more tumultuous. </p>
        <p>Unlike the elves and gnomes above ground who rarely had conflicts with Dwarves, utilizing different parts of the same environment, Drow often directly compete with Dwarves for territory and the races are frequently prejudiced against each other. The prejudiced against Drow from Dwarves and other elves has spread among many of the other races, with the exceptions of deep gnomes, who relate to their struggles with the Dwarvish expansion, and orcs, who tend to assume anyone an elf doesn't like must be okay as a matter of principle. </p>
        <p>The large cities in most of the countries in Rundar Tor tend to be crowded, bustling, and generally fairly prosperous, with impressive architecture, though most regions outside of the large cities are quite rural—small towns and villages, often quite distanced from their closest neighbors.</p>
        <p>In addition to Dwarves, Drow, and Deep Gnomes, you can expect to see mostly orcs, humans, Dragonborn, Tieflings, and the occasional elf in the large cities, though rural regions tend to be more homogeneous. All the major trade routes are located above ground, so in addition to gnomes, Dwarves, and elves, you'll find plenty of Humans, Halflings, Dragonborn, Orcs, Tabaxi, and even the occasional Goliath.</p>
