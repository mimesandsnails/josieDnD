    <h1>NOTHOKEJTAG</h1>

        <p>The Orc homeland. For many millenia, Orcs were a small-scale, clan-based people. Cultures in Nothokejtag frequently emphasized strength, proving oneself, the strength of the tribe firstly and secondarily the strength of the individual. Increased trade as trade routes spread through the world encouraged many orcs to leave the homeland as mercenaries and swell swords, and frequently they or their descendants eventually settled down somewhere or other for good. Most Orcs were part of a confederation of clans, loosely held together by inter-marriage. Bands within these alliances might have wandered far from their homelands, but continue to greet those Orcs who belonging to the same clan network as kin wherever they find them.</p>
        <p>Back when clans were still small, individual settlements, many Orcs ended up in Arwom, where their strength and established lifeways made them a natural fit in the environment and culture of the nomadic aurochs herders already living there.</p>
        <p>Merchants tentatively interested in trading opportunities began feeling out Nothokejtag about 350 years ago, almost 70 years after the Treaty of Rorvik. Dragonborns from Achuakia and Lizardfolk in Noros already had a history of small-scale trade with the Orcs of Nothokejtag, though other nations were hesitant to start their own trade routes as it was often difficult to know which clans would be receptive to trade, and which felt threatened by foreign presences. However merchants from Brunholl, unlike many of the other nations, being from a dangerous and difficult country surrounded by threats of Giants and more (and some of them having giant ancestry), found they were not overly intimidated or alienated by Orcish culture, and were able to establish some of the first widespread alliances outside of Achuakia. Eventually many Orc clans began to rely on trade to a greater extent, which encouraged several clans in general proximity to each other who had a history of inter-clan marriage to join together in first small, then larger and larger towns and cities.</p>
        <p>Today Nothokejtag has several small, medium, and large cities in central, urban areas, though in rural regions most Orcs still tend to prefer small clan-based forts and a subsistence style of hunting and horticulture, supplemented by trade (mostly furs). There is a High King, although his powers are largely limited to overall regulation of state workings within cities, and has little power or control over the rural forts, and over social issues and disputes, which tend to still be relegated to clan leaders. In large cities, the heads of several large and powerful clans might run the city on a council, while a single clan leader might be in charge in a smaller city or town.</p>
        <p>Once a High King is chosen, he or she is ritually expelled from their clan, so as not to encourage favoritism.</p>
