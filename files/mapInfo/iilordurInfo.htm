        <h1>IILORDUR</h1>

        <p>Most of Iilordur is uninhabited, but the furthest southern points are home to the northernmost elven nations. Most of the elven territories remain heavily elven in demographics, and this is especially true for the inhospitable countries of Solsrun and Hvalba. Here you'll mostly find Moon Elves and Wild Elves, as well as several communities of semi-surface-dwelling Drow. Given the remoteness of these countries and a challenging environment that encourages at least cooperation if not friendship, it's one of the few places where other types of elves live alongside the Drow peaceably. </p>
        <p>Unable to penetrate underground more than 6 or 7 feet due to permafrost, the Drow are not completely subterranean, but rather live in sunken terf houses made or sod and stone. They tend to fare better than other elves in this region, as the 6 months of the year shrouded by darkness does not unduly affect them, given their adaptations for living underground.</p>
        <p>Wild Elves and Moon Elves live in similar turf houses during the harsh winters, but move into communal long houses in the summer months, not being particularly fond of spending any extended amount of time in dark holes.</p>
