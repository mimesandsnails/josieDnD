        <h1>VANDORÚN</h1>

        <p>Vandorûn is the Elf homeland. Most of the continent experiences mild weather with a temperate climate—mild winters and warm summers with little humidity. Little rainfall between Iilordur and Vandorûn has resulted in a dry northern climate, of steppe and desert. The rest of the continent is forested, and even the cities tend to be so full of tall and ancient trees that one can feel lost in a forest in the middle of market street.</p>
        <p>Many of the nations in Vandorûn have fairly strict immigration laws, and tend to be less diverse than the nations of northern Noros or Arwom, but more so than southern Noros and Nothokejtag. </p>
        <p>There aren't many large cities on the continent, usually only one or two in each country; with everyone else living in small to medium sized, spread-out villages. However, given that Elves live over 700 years, lasting architecture is of vital importance, so even modest villages tend to have elaborate and well constructed buildings of high-quality hard stone. The exception is the Wild Elves, who generally prefer doing the opposite: living in simple, modular homes made of organic materials that are easy to repair and replace frequently when they start to age.</p>
        <p>All of the south-eastern nations in Vandorûn, especially the coastal ones, are wealthy, capitalizing on trade. The cities here tend to be large and grand, almost as lavish as Gildroad in Urús in some cases.</p>
        <p>Vandorûn Elves—Sun Elves in particular—are often stereotyped as being at best dismissive, at worst actively prejudiced against other races. People are of course diverse and hold a variety of thoughts and opinions, but the Treaty of Rorvik is within the current lifetime of many Elves, and they remember a time when the races did not always interact so peacefully. Especially older Elves those who never or rarely travel outside the Elf homeland and “rub elbows” as it were with with those outside their race or social class can indeed sometimes be haughty, dismissive, superior, or prejudiced.</p>
