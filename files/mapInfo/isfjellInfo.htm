        <h1>ISFJELL</h1>

        <p>Isfjell is commonly considered the land of giants.</p>
        <p>Always home to more ice giants than other races due to its arctic and sub-arctic climate, it seemed a natural place to push other giant types into when the other, smaller (but more numerous) races began pushing them out of more desirable land some centuries ago.</p>
        <p>Today, storm giants and frost giants populate the more inaccessible regions of the northern tundra, while fire, stone, cloud, and hill giants tend to remain on the southern border in the relative remote safety of the Alder mountain range that run all across the length of Isfjell.</p>
        <p>The only two nations that exist in Isfjell today are Brunholl and Sarlskoga.</p>
        <p>Both nations have a repuation for being populated by stern, serious people, living in an inhospitable landscape. The locals can seem emotionally distant to outsiders, but are generally quite welcoming to strangers and supportive of their friends and neighborsâ€”they have had to be to help each other withstand the harsh landscape.</p>
        <p>More threatening than the weather to the average Brunhollian or Sarlskogan is the wildlife.</p>
        <p>Most rural towns on the countries' borders have generally peaceful relations with the nearby giant populations, but that isn't the case for the local trolls, winter wolves, and polar worms. The more remote regions can be quite treacherous, and the further north one go, the less well traveled the roads are, so it's recommended to keep one's wits about them.</p>
        <p>One of Brunholl's queens is the namesake of the eighth month of the year, Asgun.</p>
        <p>Reportedly half-frost giant (although actually only a quarter), Asgun Gunnasdotter was a fierce and powerful queen, standing at a full 7' tall. Her own giant heritage kept her kingdom safe from the ice giants of the north through a slightly rocky treaty, and frequent offerings. Previously rulers of Brunholl kept the country afloat by raiding the nearby countries in Noros, but Asgun encouraged more peaceful trade. Men who go off on raids don't always come back to their wives and children, and she believed the country would be made stronger by men who always returned home with more mercantile treasures, rather than men who returned with stolen ones, if they returned at all.</p>
        <p>Being a widowed woman in Brunholl was a tenuous position. In those days, women traditionally remained at home to defend the homestead from the near constant threats from dangerous monsters, and if their husbands died, they could not leave their farms to go raiding themselves without leaving their homes and children completely unprotected. Some widows banded together into communes so a few could remain behind and raise children and fight monsters, while the rest went a'raiding and trading to earn income, but it wasn't an ideal solution.</p>
        <p>Asgun's economic reforms led to cultural and social ones as well. In Brunholl, she was a controversial figure, seen either as a protector of women and children, or as an upstart trying to change deeply entrenched culture and tradition. But because she was physically terrifying, no one ever bothered to try to stop her. Outside of Brunholl she became something of a legendary figure, even during her natural life, and since her death, that image has spread to Brunholl as well and she is currently considered a semi-mythic hero.</p>
