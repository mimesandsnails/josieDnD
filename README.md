Hi!

Welcome to my D&D resource page.
I made this to have a single, convenient place for my players to keep track of various bits of world building they may need to access during the game or in between sessions.
It is incredibly basic, just a place to update maps and stuff.
I tested this in Google Chrome and am too lazy to test it in different browsers, so sorry if it's all wonky.
